          <strong>BIOGRAPHY:</strong><br>
          Sonic is the world's fastest supersonic hedgehog! He's basically carefree, but he can't stand evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is short-tempered, but if there's someone in trouble, he would go help them with his kind nature.
        </p>

          <strong>BRIEF GAMEPLAY DESCRIPTION:</strong><br>
          Sonic plays mostly like in other Sonic games. If you have played a Sonic game before, you may be familiar with his gameplay style.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, he has special abilities up his sleeves. If you are looking for fast-paced action, Sonic is the best character of choice.

          <strong>SPIN ATTACK:</strong><br>
          During a jump, press the <strong>A button</strong> once more to perform the Spin Attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Spin Attack makes Sonic create a rapid 360 degree spiral flashing around him.

          <strong>JUMP DASH:</strong><br>
          While jumping, press <strong>LEFT</strong> or <strong>RIGHT</strong> on the circle pad to dash in mid-air.
        </p>
        <p>
          This allows Sonic to jump further.

        </p>
        <img src="screenshots/sonic3.png" class="center">
        <p>
          Press the <strong>B button</strong> 3 times in a row to make Sonic slide.
        </p>
        <p>
          These moves allow Sonic to attack in front of him while standing still or moving slowly.

          <strong>GRINDING ON RAILS:</strong><br>
          Both Sonic and Amy can grind on rails. To do so, jump on the top of the rail.<br>
        </p>
        <img src="screenshots/sonic6.png" class="center">
        <p>
          While grinding, you can speed up or slow down by using the circle pad, or jump off by pressing the <strong>A button</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you grind all the way down, you will launch yourself up off the rail.

          <strong><span style="color: lime;">NEW!</span> DESCEND DASH:</strong><br>
          While jumping, press the <strong>B button</strong> to perform the Descend Dash.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Descend Dash is a brand-new ability that allows Sonic to descend quickly during a jump.

        <p>
          <strong>CLIMBING STEEP UPHILL SLOPES:</strong><br>
          If the Spin Dash isn't powerful enough to climb a long uphill slope, you can still climb it by performing somersaults and slides.
        </p>
        <p>
          While on foot, press the <strong>B button</strong> multiple times until you reach the top.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/sonic9.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>STOP MOVING IMMEDIATELY:</strong><br>
          You can stop moving and standing still in an instance by performing somersaults.
        </p>
        <p>
          Press the <strong>B button</strong> twice in a row to stop moving.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong><span style="color: lime;">NEW!</span> BOUNCING VERY HIGH:</strong><br>
          You can bypass certain obstacles with the help of the Descend Dash. If you see a badnik or an item box, bounce on it with the Descend Dash to jump very high.
        </p>
        <p>
          While jumping, press and hold down the <strong>B button</strong> to perform a Descend Dash and try to land on the target.<br>
          Once done correctly, Sonic bounces very high. The higher you start performing the move, the higher your bounce will become.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong><span style="color: lime;">NEW!</span> QUICK HIGH JUMP ON TRAMPOLINES:</strong><br>
          You can jump very high immediately from a trampoline by using the Descend Dash.
        </p>
        <p>
          While jumping, press the <strong>B button</strong> on top of the trampoline.
