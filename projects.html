        <p>If you want to give some help for the game mod development, this page is for you!</p>
        <p><strong>You can check the different tasks for the game mod development down below.</strong></p>
      </div>
      <br><hr><h1 id="translation">Game Translation</h1>
      <div class="block">
        <p>This task is simple: Translate the game into different languages. Because the game now features a language setting, we can add more languages in the game!</p>
        <p>If you want to help for the translation, either by adding new languages or even correcting probable grammar/verbal inconsistencies, you can extract the game's APK file and verify the content in the <strong>lang</strong> folders. Otherwise, contact <strong>Furrican</strong> so he can send you the language folders.</p>
        <p>
          Here are the available languages in the game and their folder names:<br>
          <ul><strong>
            <li>lang1: English</li>
            <li>lang2: French</li>
            <li>lang3: Spanish</li>
            <li>lang4: Brazilian Portuguese</li>
            <li>lang5: German</li>
            <li>lang6: Italian</li>
            <li>lang7: Russian</li>
            <li>lang8: Japanese</li>
            <li>lang9: Simplified Chinese</li>
          </strong></ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          And here are the possible languages that can be added in the game:<br>
          <ul><strong>
            <li>Latin Spanish</li>
            <li>Traditional Portuguese</li>
            <li>Turkish</li>
            <li>Traditional Chinese</li>
          </strong></ul>
        </p>
        <p>You can also work on other languages of your preferences. However, some languages may only be verified by your own responsibility.</p>

      <br><hr><h1 id="soundlag">Fix the Sound Effects Lag</h1>
      <div class="block">
        <p>The Android port of Sonic Advance actually have an issue with its sound effects.<br>
          <strong>In certain Android devices, the game lags considerably when trying to play multiple sound effects at the same time.</strong><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          The lag is more apparent when collecting multiple rings at great speed.<br>
          <strong>However, the lag is not present when the volume is turned off.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The issue may comes from the sound channels.</strong> When the game plays sound effects, those sounds play on sound channels.<br>
          But when too many sound effects are playing at once, the game tries to play one or a few sound effects at a time, instead of overlapping sound effects when the sound channels are all used. As the result, the game lags when playing those sound effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, you may notice that the <strong>MIDI</strong> soundtrack makes the game laggier than the <strong>GBA MIX</strong> soundtrack. This is because the <strong>MIDI</strong> soundtrack uses .mid tracks, which takes multiple sound channels. Whereas the <strong>GBA MIX</strong> soundtrack only uses one, as the tracks are actually .ogg tracks turned into .mid files.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to know how the sound effects behave in the game, you can check the following files in the smali folder.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <strong>Lib</strong>:
          <ul><strong>
            <li>SoundSystem</li>
          </strong></ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          In <strong>com/sega/mobile/framework/device</strong>:
          <ul><strong>
            <li>MFSound</li>
            <li>MFPlayer</li>
          </strong></ul>

      <div class="block">
        <p>This project is a special task with the goal of making the game running at 60fps and at normal speed. This task takes a lot time, patience and requires a good amount of knowledge about Java/Smali programming.</p>
