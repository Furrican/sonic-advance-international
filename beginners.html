          <strong>CHARACTER MOVEMENT:</strong><br>

          <strong>JUMPING:</strong><br>
          They can also jump by pressing the <strong>A button</strong>. Jumping also serves as an attack (except for Amy).

          <strong><span style="color: lime;">NEW!</span> PRESERVING JUMP HEIGHT BY BOUNCING:</strong><br>
          If you spin jump by holding down the <strong>A button</strong> and land on a badnik or an item box, you will bounce slightly higher than your jump height.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Amy, you have to use the Hammer Whirl ability (check Amy's Tips & Hints for more information).

          <strong>SPIN DASH:</strong><br>
          The Spin Dash allows you to build up speed and propel you forward in an instant (except for Amy).<br>
          Hold down <strong>DOWN</strong> on the circle pad and press the <strong>A button</strong> to perform the Spin Dash. Then, release <strong>DOWN</strong> to propel you forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          When holding <strong>DOWN</strong>, the more you press the <strong>A button</strong> rapidly, the more speed you build.

          While running, press <strong>DOWN</strong> on the circle pad to roll into a ball (except for Amy).
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>UPHILL SLOPES AND LOOPS:</strong><br>
          If you move fast enough, you can traverse obstacles like uphill slopes and loops.<br>
          Hold down the desired direction on the circle pad to keep moving. If you release the circle pad too soon, you will fall off or descend from the obstacle and you have to find a way to build up speed.

          <strong>SPRINGS:</strong><br>
          Yellow springs make you jump higher than a typical jump, whereas red springs make you jump high or push yourself to the direction they are facing.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you play as Amy, you can hit a vertical or diagonal spring with her Piko Piko Hammer to jump yourself even higher than a regular spring jump.
        </p>

          <strong>DASH PANELS:</strong><br>
          Dash panels are used to propel you forward in an instant.<br>
          When a dash panel is placed before a vertical uphill slope, use it to launch yourself from the top of the slope.

          <strong>BADNIKS:</strong><br>
          Badniks are robots created by Dr. Eggman for his evil plan. He created them by turning animals into robots.<br>
          You can defeat a Badnik by attacking. Doing so will reveal an animal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each badnik has its own behaviors. Learn their patterns to defeat them efficently.<br>
          Watch out for those who can defend themselves, as they can make you receive damage.

          <strong>TRAMPOLINES:</strong><br>

          <strong>SPIKES:</strong><br>
          Spikes are an obstacle you have to avoid. If you touch the top of the spikes, you will receive damage.<br>
          Some spikes may move in and out of the floor. So be careful.

      <br><hr><h1 id="rings">Rings</h1>
      <div class="block">
        <p>
          The rings are scattered around in the stages. They are an essentail item to collect and serve multiple purposes.
        </p>
        <br><img src="screenshots/beginners_point1.gif" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>SURVIVE DAMAGE:</strong><br>
          The main use of the rings is to protect the player from damage. When you get hit, you lose all your rings and they scatter around.<br>
          You can collect the scattered rings back before they disappear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be careful not to get hit when you have 0 rings, or else you will lose a life.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you collect 100 rings, you will earn an extra life.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/beginners_point6.gif" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>PATH TO FOLLOW:</strong><br>
          The rings in areas can also be used as a guide. This is useful when you don't know where to go next.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <p>
          <strong>ITEM BOXES:</strong><br>
          You can also find rings inside item boxes.<br>
          The number of rings you can earn is based on the indicated number on the item box (5, 10 or ?).
