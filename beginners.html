        <p>
          Each badnik has its own behaviours. Learn their patterns to defeat them efficently.<br>
          Watch out for those who can defend themselves, as they can make you receive damage.

      <br><hr><h1 id="rings">Rings</h1>
      <div class="block">
        <p>
          The rings are scattered around in the stages. They are an essentail item to collect and serve multiple purposes.
        </p>
        <br><img src="screenshots/beginners_point1.gif" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>SURVIVE DAMAGE:</strong><br>
          The main use of the rings is to protect the player from damage. When you get hit, you lose all your rings and they scatter around.<br>
          You can collect the scattered rings back before they disappear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be careful not to get hit when you have 0 rings, or else you will lose a life.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you collect 100 rings, you will earn an extra life.

      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/beginners_point6.gif" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>PATH TO FOLLOW:</strong><br>
          The rings in areas can also be used as a guide. This is useful when you don't know where to go next.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <p>
          <strong>ITEM BOXES:</strong><br>
          You can also find rings inside item boxes.<br>
          The number of rings you can earn is based on the indicated number on the item box (5, 10 or ?).
