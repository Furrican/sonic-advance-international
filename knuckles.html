          <strong>BRIEF GAMEPLAY DESCRIPTION:</strong><br>
          Knuckles plays like in other Sonic games. Most of his abilities are dedicated to exploration.

        <p>
          However, Knuckles also have abilities dedicated to combat, making him a great character for fighting.

        </p>
        <p>
          While gliding, press the circle pad in the opposite direction to turn around.

          <strong>CLIMBING:</strong><br>
          If Knuckles bumps into a wall while gliding, he will hang on the wall.
