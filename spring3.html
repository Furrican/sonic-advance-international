          <strong>STEP 1:</strong><br>
          First, you need to take the higher path of the act. Either by jumping on high platforms at the beginning or by taking the first pole to launch yourself upwards.
        </p>
        <img src="screenshots/sp3-2.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>When taking the high path, don't take the spiral tube slide! Otherwise, you won't be able to go back up!</strong><br>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/sp3-3.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>STEP 2:</strong><br>
          Try to jump your way on the S O N I C letters and go down at the end of the higher path.<br>
          You can also perform a Spin Dash to jump on the other side.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/sp3-4.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>STEP 3:</strong><br>
          After falling off at the end of the high path, you will see a diagonal spring below.<br>
          Jump on the spring to go up. Make sure to time your jump, as the bumpers may prevent you from going up.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you play as Tails, you can just fly to the next step.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/sp3-5.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>STEP 4:</strong><br>
          Then, look above and you will see floating balloons and an Invincibility item box.<br>
          Jump on the ballons to go up and take the yellow spring to the left.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/sp3-6.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>STEP 5:</strong><br>
          Finally, you need to jump on the platform where the Special Spring is located right after a long uphill.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/sp3-7.png" class="center">
        <p>
          And voila! You found the Special Spring location!
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>RECOVERY 1:</strong><br>
          If you fell off during <strong>STEP 2</strong>, you can land on a flipper. Launch yourself from it either to go back from where you came, or to land on a small moving platform between 2 bumpers. <strong>Be careful not to fall off when trying to land on the flipper!</strong>
        </p>
        <img src="screenshots/sp3-9.png" class="center">
        <p>
          If you take the small moving platform between the bumpers and jump to the right or fell off after <strong>STEP 2</strong>, you can take the pinball slide to continue.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/sp3-10.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>RECOVERY 2:</strong><br>
          If you fell off during <strong>RECOVERY 1</strong> and you don't want to take the flipper, you can still reach the pinball slide by taking momentum from a Spin Dash to the right.<br>
          You can also take the path below the pinball slide to move on.
        </p>
        <img src="screenshots/sp3-11.png" class="center">
        <p>
          If you decide to take the path below the pinball slide, you will eventually find the diagonal spring above you. <strong>Be careful not to fall!</strong>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/sp3-12.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>RECOVERY 3:</strong><br>
          <strong>If you bypass the Special Spring location too fast, due to the poles, don't take the spiral tube slide! Otherwise, you won't be able to go back!</strong><br>
          Instead, go back to the left and jump on the platform where the Special Spring is located.
